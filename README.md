# Faster-Route-Calculator
Small script which logs into trafinfo, downloads latest vmslog, and prints the percentage of messages which display FASTER ROUTE during the morning rush hour (6-10am).\
The script requires a config.ini file which contains the username and password for the website, as well the path to the user's downloads folder.
